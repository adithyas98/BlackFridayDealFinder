# Black Friday Web Scraper

This will be a project that will find the deals with the most discounts across a couple of websites. This will then output a csv file for reference when finding different deals based on what the user searches. 

### The Stores

- Amazon(Complete)
- Best Buy(Complete)
- Target
- Walmart
- GameStop
- Kohls

## Next Steps

A possible next step would be to create a django website to house and show all of these deals.
