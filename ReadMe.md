# Black Friday Web Scraper

This will be a project that will find the deals with the most discounts across a couple of websites. This will then output a csv file for reference when finding different deals based on what the user searches. 

### The Stores

- Amazon(Complete)
- Best Buy(Complete)
- Target
- Nebraska Furniture Mart
- Walmart(Done, but could use improvement)

## Next Steps

A possible next step would be to create a django website to house and show all of these deals. Walmart could use some work as well as it is really weird with its HTML where some items have different HTML fields making it very difficult to scrape
